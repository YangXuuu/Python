### Question 1
Splitting genomic DNA
Look in the chapter_3 folder for a file called genomic_dna.txt – it contains the same piece of genomic DNA that we were using in the final exercise from chapter 2. 
Write a program that will split the genomic DNA into coding and non-coding parts, and write these sequences to two separate files.
Hint: use your solution to the last exercise from chapter 2 as a starting point. Writing a FASTA file



### Question 2
Writing a FASTA file
FASTA file format is a commonly-used DNA and protein sequence file format. A single sequence in FASTA format looks like this:
 >sequence_name
 ATCGACTGATCGATCGTACGAT
Where sequence_name is a header that describes the sequence (the greater-than symbol indicates the start of the header line). Often, the header contains an accession number that relates to the record for the sequence in a public sequence database. 
A single FASTA file can contain multiple sequences, like this:
 >sequence_one
 ATCGATCGATCGATCGAT
 >sequence_two
 ACTAGCTAGCTAGCATCG
 >sequence_three
 ACTGCATCGATCGTACCT
 
 Write a program that will create a FASTA file for the following three sequences – make sure that all sequences are in upper case and only contain the bases A, T, G and C.
  Sequence header
    ABC123
    DEF456
    HIJ789
DNA sequence
ATCGTACGATCGATCGATCGCTAGACGTATCG
  actgatcgacgatcgatcgatcacgact
 ACTGAC-ACTGT--ACTGTA----CATGTG
        
        
### Question 3        
Writing multiple FASTA files
Use the data from the previous exercise, but instead of creating a single FASTA file, create three new FASTA files – one per sequence. 
The names of the FASTA files should be the same as the sequence header names, with the extension .fasta.
