Reminder: the descriptions of the exercises are deliberately terse and may be somewhat ambiguous 
(just like requirements for programs you will write in real life). See the solutions for in-depth discussions of the exercises.

1.
Calculating AT content
Here's a short DNA sequence:
 ACTGATCGATTACGTATAGTATTTGCTATCATACATATATATCGATGCGTTCAT
Write a program that will print out the AT content of this DNA sequence. 
Hint: you can use normal mathematical symbols like add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), divide (/) and parentheses to carry out calculations on numbers in Python.
Reminder: if you're using Python 2 rather than Python 3, include this line at the top of your program:
>>>from __future__ import division

2.
Complementing DNA
Here's a short DNA sequence:
 ACTGATCGATTACGTATAGTATTTGCTATCATACATATATATCGATGCGTTCAT
Write a program that will print the complement of this sequence.



3. 
Restriction fragment lengths
Here's a short DNA sequence:
 ACTGATCGATTACGTATAGTAGAATTCTATCATACATATATATCGATGCGTTCAT
The sequence contains a recognition site for the EcoRI restriction enzyme, which cuts at the motif G*AATTC (the position of the cut is indicated by an asterisk). 
Write a program which will calculate the size of the two fragments that will be produced when the DNA sequence is digested with EcoRI.




4.
Splicing out introns, part one
Here's a short section of genomic DNA:
ATCGATCGATCGATCGACTGACTAGTCATAGCTATGCATGTAGCTACTCGATCGATCGA TCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCATGCTATCATCGATCGATATCGATGCATCGACT ACTAT
It comprises two exons and an intron. The first exon runs from the start of the sequence to the sixty-third character, and the second exon runs from the ninety- first character to the end of the sequence. 
Write a program that will print just the coding regions of the DNA sequence.



5.
Splicing out introns, part two
Using the data from part one, write a program that will calculate what percentage of the DNA sequence is coding.



6.
Splicing out introns, part three
Using the data from part one, write a program that will print out the original genomic DNA sequence with coding bases in uppercase and non-coding bases in lowercase.
